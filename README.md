# ATS-Tool

**Description**:  ATS-Tool is a free, open source and privacy-friendly web application that allows its users to upload their resume and get feedback about how it fares against the Applicant Tracking System (ATS).
  - **Problem**: The Applicant Tracking System rejects 75% of the applicants and is used by 99% of the Fortune 500 companies. Several existing website offer a resume review but it is unclear what happens with our data once it is in their hands. 
  - **Solution**: ATS-Tool will allow users to upload a pdf, word or copy paste their resume and get an instant feedback about how it compares to either a job post they are applying to, or how it fares in general against the ATS. This project will also serve as the main hub for learning everything ATS as several people are applying to jobs without even knowing that the ATS system exists and will get rejected 75% of the time.

  - **Technology stack**: The project will be built with the MERN Stack.
  - **Status**:  The project is in planning phase and it is being worked on part-time.
